# Description
This is my coding bootcamp day 45 project. 

This bit of code scrapes from an article published by The Guardian website (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/100-best-films-movies-of-the-21st-century) and creates a text file that displays, in order, the list of the top 100 movies of all times.  

## Usage

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from requests_html import HTMLSession
import requests

```
